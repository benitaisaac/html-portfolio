<h3>Mexican Gothic</h3>
<p>I just finished this book yesterday and it was a CRAZY ride. 
    I loved how the author followed the theme of colonization and compared it to 
    an old house that is falling apart, rotting, and ruining the life of 
    the family living in it. Also apparently it's all about the shrooms....

<h3>The Hidden Histories of Houseplants</h3>
<p> My housemates got this book for me and it's been a great read because 
    I'm learning more about my houseplants. One of the best things to realize
is that houseplants are really just 'wild' plants that naturally grow in certain contexts. 
The more that we learn about those contexts and recreate those conditions in our homes, 
the happier our plant babies will be. </p>

<h3>The Black Panter Party </h3>
<p>A few months ago, I did a walking tour 
    of Oakland and realized that I knew so little about the BPP even though I grew up 
    in the Bay Area. It's time for me to learn the history of the land that I live on!
